## Project Description

Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into groups of individuals who are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits. This project explores different methods, including clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques, to segment customers effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in the file [marketing_campaign.xlsx](https://github.com/Sofiaanjum/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/marketing_campaign.xlsx), which is included in this GitHub repository. The dataset contains information about customers, including their demographic data, purchase history, and response to marketing campaigns. Please download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the root directory of the project.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow (for Autoencoders, if used)

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Sofiaanjum/Customer-Segmentation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Customer-Segmentation

3. Place the marketing_campaign.xlsx dataset in the root directory.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to execute the customer segmentation analysis. You can explore various clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction techniques, and visualization methods provided in the project files.

## Results
The project aims to discover meaningful customer segments that can be used to tailor marketing strategies effectively.
